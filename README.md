### Project Proposal: Object Detection for Security Systems Using Faster R-CNN

In high-traffic areas like airports, shopping centers, or schools, it’s important to detect potentially dangerous objects people are carrying, such as weapons or restricted items, to keep everyone safe. Right now, a lot of security monitoring is done manually, which can be slow and prone to human error. My project aims to create an automated system that can detect specific objects people carry in real time, helping to speed up security responses and make the process more reliable. This was part of a project that I've been meaning to work on; the computer vision portion is only part of it, there would be a whole app system, database, website around this idea similar to other commercial systems like Ring. 
An object detection system for security could reduce the workload on human monitors and help catch potential risks more consistently. This kind of system could make security operations more effective and responsive in various settings, especially where there are large crowds or complex environments. By automating object detection, the project could also be adapted to many places, from schools to stadiums, where it’s critical to identify and respond to possible security threats.
I’ll implement a Faster R-CNN model, which is a popular two-stage CNN-based object detection approach:
The first stage involves identifying regions of interest where objects might be located using a Region Proposal Network (RPN).ca
The second stage classifies these regions and fine-tunes bounding boxes to better locate each object.
For this project:
I’ll start with a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model and fine-tune it on a dataset of objects commonly monitored in security (like electronic devices, bags, and weapons).
I plan to use open-source datasets and create more variety with data augmentation (e.g., rotation, scaling) to make the model more adaptable to different conditions.
To evaluate my model, I’ll use the mean Average Precision (mAP) (https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/map-mean-average-precision-for-object-detection-45c121a31173) metric, which is a common way to measure how accurately an object detection model can find different types of objects. I’ll also track the model’s speed in frames per second to check if it could work in real time. Additionally, I’ll observe how well the model performs in different environments, such as low-light or crowded scenes. A good outcome would be high detection accuracy and low false positives, making the model practical for real-world security use.
